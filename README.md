# Crypto-Webscraper

## Introduction 
This is a cryptocurrency webscraper I created to improve my python skills and introduce myself to new programming concecpts like webscraping and GUIs. This project uses the BeautifulSoup library to scan coinmarketcap.com and display the results into the GUI created by Tkinter. The results are also updated dynamically.

## Technologies

* Python
* Tkinter
* BeautfulSoup
* Urllib
* Command-line
* Github

## What I've learned
I learned a lot when making this program especially since I knew little to nothing about making GUIs and I was fairly knew to webscraping. In the end I learned about Tkinter syntax, BeautifulSoup syntax, and making requests with urllib.

## How to use
Run in the commandline
```
python3 gui.py
```
